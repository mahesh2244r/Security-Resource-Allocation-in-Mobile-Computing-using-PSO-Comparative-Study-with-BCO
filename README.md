**Efficient Security Resource Allocation for Mobile Computing using Particle Swarm Optimization 
Technique compared over Bee Colony Optimization Technique with Improved Accuracy**

This project presents a comparative study between Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOT) and Bee Colony Optimization (BCOT) techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of security resource allocation in mobile and cloud computing environments.

**📌 Project Overview**

In the evolving landscape of healthcare and mobile computing, clinicians increasingly rely on real-time sensor technologies and cloud services for patient monitoring. However, security remains a primary obstacle to cloud adoption. This research focuses on:



**-Problem Definition:** Effectively allocating security resources while considering constraints and system requirements.


**-Technique Comparison:** Evaluating PSOT (inspired by bird flocking) against BCOT (inspired by honeybee foraging).


**-Primary Goal:** Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of data sanitization and restoration processes.

**🛠️ Methodology & Tools**

The study utilizes a variety of meta-heuristic and machine learning approaches to solve allocation complexities.

**Technologies Used**

**-Languages/Environments:** MATLAB or Python with appropriate libraries.


**-Statistical Analysis:** SPSS for performance comparison and T-tests.


**-Optimization Algorithms:** PSOT, BCOT, AGPSO, and DMOA.

**Core Workflow**

**1.Define constraints:** Identify available resources and security requirements.


**2.Initialize Swarm:** Randomly distribute particles within the search space.


**3.Simulation**: Run problem instances with varying complexities to gather performance metrics.


**4.Statistical Validation**: Compare algorithm accuracy using independent sample T-tests.


**📊 Results & Key Findings**

The experimental results indicate that the Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (PSOT) generally outperforms the Bee Colony Optimization Technique (BCOT) in terms of mean accuracy.



| Algorithm | Mean Accuracy | Standard Deviation |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **PSOT** | 91.50% | 3.12039 |
| **BCOT** | 89.50% | 3.12039 |

The Independent Sample T-test showed a significance value of 0.052, underscoring the performance difference between the two techniques.
